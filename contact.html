                <p>I am glad that Janki Panchal's sessions were exceeded my expectation. She helped me to
                  expand my creative vision, clear blockages and some old patterns which were lowering my
                  vibration and energy. Her tarot card prediction cleared my confusion and guided me toward to
                  correct path. I am using crystals in my professional life as well as personal life to
                  maintain harmony, peace and positivity. Twin heart Mediation and angel therapy has
                  completely changed my perception of seeing life. I really appreciate her work more than I
                  can express in word. Thank you, Janki Panchal.</p>

                  crystals and crystal grid which really gives me a sense of direction in everyday life and

                  Hello ,
                  I am Reema Tailor and I am a homemaker.
                  What we say about life ?!! Life is a series of ups and downs and my life was full of mess
                  before I met Janki Panchal.
                  I was suffering health , wealth and relationship issues in my life . I was having multiple
                  issues such as depression ,anxiety , some kind of traumas, memory loss , fear , panic
                  attacks , back pain , muscles cramps , my spine got curved abnormally , varicose vein ,
                  spider veins , no strength in body & there was many imbalances between right & left part of
                  the whole body . Along with this was having family relationships issues and traumatic events
                  & facing continue suicidal thoughts running in head . Due to all this circumstances
                  somewhere my son's life was affected on negative sides.
                  In the year 2017 , I met Janki Panchal with all my issues . " Wo kehte hein na ...Bhagwan ke
                  ghar der hein , andher nahi . "<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">
                    I already lost my all hope and confidence before meeting her but she is Amazing. She helped
                    in such a way where I totally transformed myself mentally, emotionally, physically and
                    spiritually . It was an amazing journey with her. As I said my son was affected too and was
                    suffering in his teenage life but Janki helped me in his case & now he is doing his best in
                    his career life plus crystal is a beautiful part of his life. Me & my both children are
                    wearing her suggested crystals for good health, wealth , happiness , success and better
                    relationships.
                    Janki suggested me to do Pranic healing course from certified Pranic Healing Trainers where
                    I learnt to heal my body by myself.
                    Janki's prediction is outstanding in every area of my life . Meditation, Crystals , Healing
                    and Angel Prayers are the best part of my life.
                    There are no enough words to express about Janki . She is Amazing , Beautiful Soul , Expert
                    Reader , Life Coach, Excellent Counselor and Guide , Open minded girl & an " Earth Angel "
                    for me. I am always grateful to her and her all work . She gave me Second Life in my
                    Existing Life .
                    Problems & obstacles are part of life but it's our attitude how we deal with it . With her
                    guidance and help I simply learnt this & sorted my life.
                    Thank you . Thank you . Thank you so much.</span>

                <p>I met Janki in 2016 (22/02/2016 on a precise note).
                  At that time my life hit the new low and nothing was going RIGHT in my life. I was on the
                  verge of depression and totally clueless and directionless.
                  I was the girl who was not even believing in GOD at that time and my circumstances made me
                  more bitter. But somehow, I wanted to see her and wanted to check if TAROT can help me. So
                  as a last resort I requested her for consultation.
                  What I was not aware was that “ MY LIFE WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE AND FOR THE BEST” . The moment I
                  met was my POINT OF NO RETURN TO SORROW.<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">
                    “The TAROT reading was not so great due to my thought process, but she did not stop there”.
                    She was totally loving and having compassion for my situation and she really wanted to help
                    me flow through. So, She started working on my thought process and my belief in life. Due to
                    their constant guidance and care I started noticing changes in few weeks. The remedies and
                    practices she was giving me looked so minute and doable. And I did not know it had such a
                    great power to change from -ve to +ve and from wrong to right. I did not know the power of
                    my thoughts only but she knew so she kept working and I followed everything what she told me
                    to do and of course she was always there.
                    And as a result I started succeeding in different areas of my life. I started gaining my
                    confidence back. I started seeing positives in lowest situation and kept smiling and kept
                    going. My GRIEF converted in GRATITUDE. I was living life in the fullest in the same
                    situation where I was depressed 3 months back. And the journey continued. Today its been 5
                    years and I can not tell you the change it had brought me. My professional success is
                    unparallel. I am most cheerful person in my office and my family. My love life is bloomed
                    and cherished. I am called as most HAPPIEST person wherever I go. The change is so beautiful
                    and glorious that I do not have words for.
                    My life is changed and only person I want to give credit to JANKI PANCHAL and she knows how
                    much I love and adore her.</span></p>

                <p>*TAROT READING PRICE :- Don’t judge the price but think as an opportunity of life changing
                  experience. You will never be disappointed and its my promise.
                  <br />
                  *TAROT READING :- It is most accurate reading. All the readings in these 5 years are and
                  were accurate and never was to please anyone. So any of the card you feel is not what you
                  desired please do not hold back. God has everything covered. There is another door which
                  will be waiting for all of us. But prediction will be perfect, you will realize later on.
                  <br /><span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">
                    *JANKI’S LANGUAGE :- She is brave and upfront so may be you feel that it's harsh but it's
                    her confidence and way to live life. She is headstrong woman and lives the same way. So if
                    you feel she does not understand your feeling while explaining your reading or prediction,
                    it is not the case. She is most compassionate and loving person but she believes in results
                    and not in the SOB story but how can we CORRECT it. So her focus is different as is her
                    approach. So try to believe in her and then see the results.
                    <br />
                    *PRANIC PSYCOTHERAPY :- This is the best healing technique I have ever experience. She had
                    done healing for my father and my grand father and it really worked like magic. I vouch for
                    this.

                <p>Janki Panchal, my support pillar , my sister. She introduced me to Tarot in 2015, till then I had
                  been influenced and trapped in different stories and solutions by different astrologers I met. I never
                  obtained proper guidance or solution. I had lots of problems in my life. Tarot was an ultimate turning
                  point that helped me in taking perfect decisions. Every perfect decision gives positive direction for
                  this one precious lifetime. I always recieved fruitful outcome and I proudly say that I am very
                  satisfied with every decision I made through tarot . This could be possible only because of extreme
                  dedication, experience and perseverance by JP in this field. I confidently with my personal guarantee
                  recommend her to all my friends reading this right now to experience and use this powerful angelic
                  guidance from one and only Janki Panchal .
